title: Announcing TestURL
subtitle: A Free Tool for Web Accessibility Testing
---

As a project of my consulting business, Access Success LLC, I have developed TestURL, a free, open-source and cross-platform tool for testing web pages against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The software provides a convenient and efficient method of conducting automated testing by anyone comfortable with the command line, either on Windows or MacOS.

Key features of TestURL include:

- Testing done by specifying either a single URL, or multiple URLs listed in a text file, enabling many pages to be tested in a single, unattended execution of the program.

- HTML reports with meaningful and unique file names, so the results can easily be recognized, and they are saved without risk of being replaced by subsequent results.

- Use of high quality APIs in the field: Deque Axe for testing, and Microsoft Accessibility Insights for reporting.

Note that manual testing is also needed for evaluating web accessibility.

The TestURL project is available on the web at \
